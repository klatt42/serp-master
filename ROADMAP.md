**Timeline:** 20-week phased rollout (MVP in 4 weeks)

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Vision: Modern SEO for Small Business

SERP-Master addresses the fundamental shift in how people search and discover businesses:

**The Problem:**
- 70%+ of searches now happen OUTSIDE of Google (YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Reddit, AI tools)
- Traditional SEO tools only audit Google rankings
- Small businesses don't understand entity-based optimization
- AI search engines require different optimization (AEO vs SEO)
- Platform-specific intent is ignored (discovery vs research vs decision)

**The Solution:**
SERP-Master provides a **two-pillar approach** that mirrors the modern SEO strategy:

**PILLAR 1: Know Where You Stand (Website Performance Analyzer)**
- Comprehensive audit across SEO/GEO/AEO dimensions
- Multi-platform presence checking (YouTube, TikTok, etc.)
- Entity clarity and consistency validation
- Engagement signal tracking (reviews, social proof)
- Competitor positioning analysis
→ **Goal:** Understand your current digital footprint and systematically improve

**PILLAR 2: Find Where to Compete (Niche Discovery Engine)**
- Platform-specific keyword opportunities
- High volume + low competition + low CPC filtering
- Cross-platform content strategy generation
- Intent-based platform matching
→ **Goal:** Discover untapped opportunities before creating content
