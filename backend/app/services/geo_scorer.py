PHASE 2 GEO IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

Week 5 Implementation Plan:

1. Multi-Location Optimization (15 points):
   - Detect location-specific pages
   - Validate unique content per location
   - Check for location-specific schema
   - Analyze internal linking between locations
   - Score: 15/15 if 3+ locations with unique content

2. Local Citations Consistency (10 points):
   - Integrate with citation data sources
   - Check NAP consistency across directories
   - Validate citation count and quality
   - Score: 10/10 if NAP consistent across 10+ citations

3. Geographic Content Relevance (10 points):
   - Analyze geographic keywords
   - Check service area mentions
   - Validate location-specific content depth
   - Score: 10/10 if strong geo-content strategy

4. Google Business Profile Integration (10 points):
   - API integration with GBP
   - Check profile completeness
   - Analyze review count and ratings
   - Validate posts and updates frequency
   - Score: 10/10 if optimized GBP

Data Sources to Integrate:
- Google Business Profile API
- Citation data (Moz Local, BrightLocal, or custom crawler)
- Google Maps API for location validation
- Review aggregation APIs

Manual Input Features:
- Location management interface
- Citation tracking
- Review monitoring
- Multi-location dashboard

Dependencies to Add:
- google-api-python-client (for GBP integration)
- geopy (for address validation and geocoding)
- Additional APIs based on final feature set
