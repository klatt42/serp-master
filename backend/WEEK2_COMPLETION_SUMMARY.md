**Competitors don't have this:** We're the only tool analyzing how clearly AI can understand business identity.

### 2. Comprehensive AEO Scoring

**What we provide:**
- Voice search optimization insights
- AI platform readiness (Google Assistant, Alexa, ChatGPT, Perplexity)
- Conversational content analysis
- Schema markup validation

### 3. Quick Wins Feature
**Why it matters:** Users want immediate actionable insights.

**What we deliver:**
