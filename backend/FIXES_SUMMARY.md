# SERP-Master DataForSEO Integration - Fixes Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Issue:** On-Page API crawls failing with 404 and hanging at 10% progress

---

## Critical Discovery: Wrong Endpoint

### The Problem
We were using the **wrong endpoint** to retrieve On-Page API results.

### What We Were Doing (WRONG)
```
GET https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/on_page/task_get/{task_id}
```
**Result:** Always returned 404 "Not Found"

### What We Should Be Doing (CORRECT)
```
GET https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/on_page/summary/{task_id}
```
**Result:** Works correctly! ‚úÖ

### Why This Matters
- The On-Page API uses **different endpoints** than SERP API
- SERP API uses `/task_get/` but On-Page API uses `/summary/`
- This is documented but easy to miss
- The official Python client uses `on_page_task_get_advanced()` which maps to `/summary/`

---

## Key Implementation Fixes

### 1. Correct Endpoint Usage
**File:** `app/services/dataforseo_client.py:320`

```python
# CRITICAL: On-Page API uses /summary/ endpoint, NOT /task_get/
endpoint = f"on_page/summary/{task_id}"
```

### 2. Proper Status Code Handling
**File:** `app/services/dataforseo_client.py:337-346`

```python
# Status codes:
# 20000 = OK (task completed successfully)
# 40100 = Task In Queue (still processing - not an error!)
# 40300 = Task In Progress (still processing - not an error!)
if status_code == 40100 or "Task In Queue" in status_msg:
    raise Exception("TASK_IN_QUEUE")  # Special marker for in-progress tasks
elif status_code == 40300 or "Task In Progress" in status_msg:
    raise Exception("TASK_IN_PROGRESS")  # Special marker for in-progress tasks
elif status_code != 20000:
    raise Exception(f"Task failed: {status_msg}")
```

### 3. Updated Status Checking Logic
**File:** `app/services/site_crawler.py:184-199`

```python
except Exception as direct_error:
    error_msg = str(direct_error)

    # Check for in-progress status markers
    if "TASK_IN_QUEUE" in error_msg or "TASK_IN_PROGRESS" in error_msg:
        logger.info("Task is still queued/processing")
        return "crawling"

    # 404 means task not ready yet
    if "404" in error_msg:
        logger.info("Task not ready yet (404)")
        return "crawling"

    # Other error - actual failure
    logger.error(f"Error checking task status: {direct_error}")
    return "failed"
```

### 4. Use Original Task ID
**Important:** Must use the original task ID from `task_post` response, NOT IDs from `tasks_ready`.

- ‚úÖ Use: Task ID from `task_post` response (e.g., `10061422-1060-0216-0000-72077faf5fdc`)
- ‚ùå Don't use: Task IDs from `tasks_ready` (these are for different functions)

---

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Test: example.com (5 pages)
```bash
Task created: 10061422-1060-0216-0000-72077faf5fdc
Wait time: 180 seconds
Result: SUCCESS!
Crawl progress: finished
```

**Conclusion:** The endpoint fix works correctly for small crawls.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: prismspecialtiesdmv.com (10-50 pages)
```bash
Task created: 10061435-1060-0216-0000-a86c3dbd10e8
Wait time: 4+ minutes
Status: TASK_IN_QUEUE (indefinitely)
Result: Times out
```

**Conclusion:** Tasks remain in queue indefinitely for this specific website.

## DataForSEO Status Codes Reference

| Code | Message | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| 20000 | Ok | Task completed successfully | Retrieve results |
| 20100 | Task Created | Task accepted and created | Start polling |
| 40100 | Task In Queue | Task waiting to be processed | Keep polling |
| 40300 | Task In Progress | Task currently being processed | Keep polling |
| 40400 | Not Found | Task ID doesn't exist | Check task ID |

## Remaining Issue: Long Queue Times

### Problem
Tasks for prismspecialtiesdmv.com remain in "TASK_IN_QUEUE" status for 4+ minutes without progressing.

### Possible Causes
1. **DataForSEO Queue Backlog:** High volume of tasks in their system
2. **Account Limitations:** Free/trial accounts may have lower priority
3. **Website-Specific Issues:** Target website may be slow or blocking crawlers
4. **Service Disruption:** Temporary issue with DataForSEO's crawling infrastructure

### What We've Ruled Out
- ‚ùå Wrong endpoint (fixed)
- ‚ùå Wrong task ID (using correct original ID)
- ‚ùå Insufficient funds ($49 balance, tasks cost $0.0125-$0.0625)
- ‚ùå Rate limiting (well under API limits)
- ‚ùå Authentication issues (task creation works)
- ‚ùå Implementation errors (example.com works fine)

### Recommended Actions
1. **Contact DataForSEO Support** with task ID examples
2. **Ask about queue priority** for account type
3. **Request queue time estimates** for On-Page API
4. **Inquire about TASK_IN_QUEUE timeout** behavior

## Files Changed

1. **`app/services/dataforseo_client.py`**
   - Line 320: Changed endpoint from `on_page/task_get/` to `on_page/summary/`
   - Lines 337-346: Added proper status code handling for queue/in-progress states

2. **`app/services/site_crawler.py`**
   - Lines 184-199: Updated error handling to recognize queue states as "crawling" not "failed"

---

## API Workflow (Corrected)

```
1. POST /v3/on_page/task_post
   ‚Üì
   Response: { "tasks": [{ "id": "TASK_ID", "status_code": 20100 }] }

2. Save TASK_ID from response

3. Wait 10+ seconds

4. GET /v3/on_page/summary/TASK_ID  ‚Üê CORRECT ENDPOINT!
   ‚Üì
   Response Options:
   - 40100 "Task In Queue" ‚Üí Keep waiting
   - 40300 "Task In Progress" ‚Üí Keep waiting
   - 20000 "Ok" ‚Üí Results ready! Parse and return

5. Poll every 10-15 seconds until status_code = 20000
```

---

## Next Steps for Development

1. ‚úÖ **Endpoint corrected** - Using `/summary/` instead of `/task_get/`
2. ‚úÖ **Status handling fixed** - Properly handling queue/in-progress states
3. ‚úÖ **Tested with example.com** - Works correctly after 3-minute wait
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Awaiting DataForSEO support** - Need resolution for long queue times
5. üî≤ **Consider fallback strategy** - Implement timeout with user notification
6. üî≤ **Add queue position indicator** - If DataForSEO provides this data

## Code References

- **Endpoint fix:** `app/services/dataforseo_client.py:320`
- **Status handling:** `app/services/dataforseo_client.py:337-346`
- **Error handling:** `app/services/site_crawler.py:184-199`
- **Poll interval:** `app/services/site_crawler.py:29` (10 seconds)
- **Max poll time:** `app/services/site_crawler.py:30` (600 seconds / 10 minutes)

---

**Summary:** We've fixed the critical endpoint issue and the integration now works correctly for small crawls. The remaining issue is DataForSEO-side queue processing time for larger crawls, which requires support investigation.
