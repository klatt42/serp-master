## ✅ Quick Pass/Fail Checklist

Run these commands and check for expected results:

```bash
# 1. Git commits (should return 12)
git log --oneline --all | grep -i "week" | wc -l

# 2. Route files (should return 7)
ls backend/app/api/*.py | wc -l

# 3. Week 12 services (should return 6)
ls backend/app/services/ai_generation/*.py 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# 4. Frontend pages (should return 10+)
find frontend/app -name "page.tsx" | wc -l

# 5. Backend running (should return 200)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000/health

# 6. Week 12 health (should return 200)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000/api/generation/health

# 7. Routers in main.py (should return 7)
grep "include_router" backend/app/main.py | wc -l
```

**If all 7 commands return expected values → ALL WEEKS 1-12 COMPLETE ✅**

echo "=== Routers ===" && \
grep "include_router" backend/app/main.py | wc -l

# Expected output:
