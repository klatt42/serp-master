## Component Architecture

### Main Component: IssuePriorityList

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface IssuePriorityListProps {
  issues: {
    critical: Issue[];
    warnings: Issue[];
    info: Issue[];
    quick_wins: Issue[];
  };
  onIssueClick?: (issue: Issue) => void;
  onMarkResolved?: (issueId: string) => void;
}
```

**State Management:**
- `activeTab` - Currently selected tab (critical, warnings, info)
- `expandedIssues` - Set of expanded issue IDs
- `resolvedIssues` - Set of resolved issue IDs
- `searchQuery` - Current search text
- `categoryFilter` - Active category filter (ALL, SEO, AEO, GEO)

**Key Functions:**
- `filterIssues()` - Filters issues by search and category
- `exportToCSV()` - Generates and downloads CSV
- `getEffortBadge()` - Returns color classes for effort level
- `getCategoryColor()` - Returns color classes for category

### Sub-Components

**1. TabButton**
- Reusable tab component
- Props: tab, label, count, active, icon, color
- Handles click events
- Responsive design with icon + text

**2. IssueCard**

- Click to expand details
- Checkbox to mark resolved
- Responsive layout

**3. IssueDetails**

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme

**Severity Colors:**
- Critical: Red (#EF4444, #FEE2E2)
- Warning: Yellow (#F59E0B, #FEF3C7)
- Info: Blue (#3B82F6, #DBEAFE)

**Effort Badge Colors:**
- Low: Green (#10B981, #D1FAE5)
- Medium: Yellow (#F59E0B, #FEF3C7)
- High: Red (#EF4444, #FEE2E2)

**Category Colors:**
- SEO: Blue (#3B82F6, #DBEAFE)
- AEO: Green (#10B981, #D1FAE5)
- GEO: Purple (#8B5CF6, #EDE9FE)

### Animations
- Smooth expand/collapse transitions
- Hover effects on cards
- Filter button state changes
- Tab switching animations

### Responsive Design
- Mobile: Single column, stacked layout
- Tablet: Optimized spacing, readable text
- Desktop: Full layout with side-by-side elements

---

## State Management Strategy

### Efficient Lookups with Sets
```typescript
const [expandedIssues, setExpandedIssues] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [resolvedIssues, setResolvedIssues] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

**Why Sets?**
- O(1) lookup time for checking if issue is expanded/resolved
- Easy add/remove operations
- Better performance than arrays for this use case

### Memoized Filtering
```typescript
const currentIssues = useMemo(() => {
  return filterIssues(issues[activeTab]);
}, [activeTab, issues, searchQuery, categoryFilter]);
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-filtering
- Optimizes performance with large issue lists
- Only recalculates when dependencies change

---

## Build Status

```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 4.0s
✓ Linting passed
✓ Type checking passed
✓ Static and dynamic pages generated
```

**Bundle Sizes:**
- Audit page: 123 kB (includes IssuePriorityList)
- First Load JS: 327 kB
- No build errors or warnings

---

## Data Flow

### 1. Backend → Frontend
```
Backend API returns AuditResults with issues:
{
  issues: {
    critical: [...],
    warnings: [...],
    info: [...],
    quick_wins: [...]
  }
}
```

### 2. Audit Results Page
```typescript
// In app/audit/[id]/page.tsx
{results.issues && (
  <div className="mt-8">
    <IssuePriorityList issues={results.issues} />
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. IssuePriorityList Component
```
1. Receives issues prop
2. Filters by activeTab
3. Applies search filter
4. Applies category filter
5. Renders filtered issue cards
6. Handles user interactions
```

---

## User Interactions

### Filtering Workflow
1. User selects tab (Critical/Warnings/Info)
2. Issues filtered by severity
3. User can apply category filter (SEO/AEO/GEO)
4. User can search by text
5. Badge counts update in real-time

### Issue Management Workflow
1. User clicks issue card to expand
2. Full details slide down with animation
3. User reads fix steps and code example
4. User marks issue as resolved
5. Visual feedback (strikethrough, opacity)

### Export Workflow
1. User clicks "Export to CSV" button
2. All issues compiled into CSV format
3. File downloads automatically
4. Filename includes current date
