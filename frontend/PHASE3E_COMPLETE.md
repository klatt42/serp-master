## AI Interaction Examples

### Example 1: Score Explanation
**User:** "Why is my AEO score only 18?"

**AI Response (via explainScore action):**
```
## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Score Explanation

**Current Score:** 18 / 25 (72.0%)

### What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?
AEO optimizes for AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI
Overviews. It focuses on structured data, question-answer content, and
entity relationships that AI can easily parse and cite.

### Key Factors Measured:
- FAQ schema and structured data
- Question-based headings and content
- Entity clarity and relationships
- Authoritative sources and citations
- Clear, concise answers
- Topic clustering and depth

### Your Performance:
You're scoring 18 out of 25 possible points, which is good but has room
for improvement.

You're missing **7 points** in this dimension.

[... detailed improvement strategy ...]
```

### Example 2: Issue Prioritization
**User:** "What should I fix first?"

**AI Response (via prioritizeIssues action with quick_wins goal):**
```
# Quick Wins Strategy

These issues give you the best ROI: high impact improvements with low
time investment. Perfect for getting fast results.

## Your Prioritized Action Plan

### 1. 🚨 Missing Meta Descriptions

**Category:** SEO | **Impact:** +3 points | **Effort:** 🟢 low
⚡ **Quick Win**

Your site is missing meta descriptions on 12 pages. Meta descriptions
improve click-through rates and help search engines understand your
content.

**Why fix this:** Add unique, compelling meta descriptions to each page
within 155 characters.

**Pages affected:** 12

[... 9 more prioritized issues ...]

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with #1** - Begin working on the highest priority issue
2. **Fix incrementally** - Don't try to fix everything at once
3. **Re-audit regularly** - Check your progress after implementing fixes
4. **Track improvements** - Note which changes moved the needle most
```

### Example 3: Fix Instructions
**User:** "How do I fix missing FAQ schema?"

**AI Response (via generateFixInstructions action):**
```
# Fix Instructions: Add FAQ Schema

🚨 **Severity:** CRITICAL | 🟡 **Effort:** medium | **Impact:** +5 points

## Problem

Your website is missing FAQ schema markup, which prevents AI systems
from easily understanding your questions and answers.

## Why This Matters

FAQ schema is one of the most powerful structured data types for AEO.
It directly feeds AI systems like ChatGPT and Google's AI Overviews,
making your content citation-worthy.

## Step-by-Step Fix (intermediate level)

1. Identify the 8 affected page(s)
2. Access your page templates or individual pages
3. Implement the fix according to the recommendation
4. Test changes in a staging environment if available
5. Deploy to production
6. Validate using browser dev tools or SEO tools
7. Re-audit to confirm resolution

**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

## Code Example

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "What is AEO?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Answer Engine Optimization..."
    }
  }]
}
```

[... additional context ...]
```

### Example 4: Competitor Comparison
**User:** "How do I compare to my competitors?"

**AI Response (via compareToCompetitors action):**
```
# Competitive Analysis: example.com

## Your Current Position

**Overall Score:** 55 / 100 (55.0%)
**Grade:** C

### Score Breakdown

- **Traditional SEO:** 18/30 (60.0%)
- **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization):** 18/25 (72.0%)
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):** 19/45 (42.2%)

## Competitive Positioning

⚠️ **You're falling behind competitors.** At 55.0%, you need immediate
action.

**Critical gaps:**
- Traditional SEO fundamentals need work
- GEO preparation is minimal

**Strategy:** Focus on critical issues first, then quick wins for rapid
improvement.

## Recommended Competitive Actions

1. **Analyze top competitors** - Run audits on 3-5 direct competitors
2. **Identify gaps** - Compare your scores dimension by dimension
3. **Prioritize differentiation** - Focus on AEO/GEO where competitors
   are weak
4. **Monitor regularly** - Track changes in competitor performance
5. **Leverage quick wins** - Get fast improvements to close gaps

💡 **Tip:** To compare against specific competitors, provide their audit
scores and I'll give you a detailed head-to-head analysis.
